## Subjects to learn more about
- Ai
- GraphQL
- Java (Spring Boot) -> Did some projects with it, but not enough to be confident in it
- Software architecture
  - I've finally rent a VPS to serve my own projects (docker, CI/CD pipelines)
- Software design patterns
  - Finally downloaded some good books on important software concepts
- Software development methodologies (DDD -> Domain Driven Design)
  - Found a mentor who was/is willing to teach me more about this (Dennis Zwart), one of the best developers that I know personally
- - Rasberry pi projects: Magic mirror[(https://magicmirror.builders/)]
- Agile methodologies (Scrum, Kanban) -> I know the basics, but not enough to be confident in it


## Currently working on
- WordPress projects (eg: https://pb21.nl/)
- MVP builder (https://micro-spark.acdaling.me/) -> paused (working on something else that will also use AI in the future)
- Apps (React native, PWAs and more) -> coming soon! (Focus is here currently)
- API's (REST) -> Node.js and Laravel (Need to make more use of laravel, it has everything I need)

## Concepts applied in my projects
- Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Model View Controller (MVC)
- Note taking, documentation and code comment practices (A very big fan of Notion (not sponsored, yet I think..))
- Version control (Git)
  - Also have found a good book to learn more
